  <h3 align="center">Point Region Quad Tree</h3>  
  <p align="center">  
    In the Point Region Quad Tree each node either has exactly four children or is a leaf. That is, the PR Quad Tree is a full four-way branching (4-ary) tree in shape. The PR Quad Treerepresents a collection of data points in two dimensions by decomposing the region containing the data points into four equal quadrants, subquadrants, and so on, until no leaf node contains more than a single point. In other words, if a region contains zero or one data points, then it is represented by a PR Quad Tree consisting of a single leaf node. If the region contains more than a single data point, then the region is split into four equal quadrants. The corresponding PR Quad Tree then contains an internal node and four subtrees, each subtree representing a single quadrant of the region, which might in turn be split into subquadrants. Each internal node of a PR Quad Tree represents a single split of the two-dimensional region. The four quadrants of the region (or equivalently, the corresponding subtrees) are designated (in order) NW, NE, SW, and SE. Each quadrant containing more than a single point would in turn be recursively divided into subquadrants until each leaf of the corresponding PR Quad Tree contains at most one point.
